# React Native Setup Crash Course

## Having your Machine Ready - 3 Easy Steps

When finsihed, you'll be able to write React Native code for iOS, Android, or both! Let's make sure your machine is ready to get rolling.

It's important that you are able to run a "Hello World" app **BEFORE** this workshop (on iOS for Mac or Android for Windows).

Let's get you setup! If these steps seem rudimentary, then good! That's why we want them out of the way before the course. 

At the training, we'll briefly go over all the tools you're about to install and will be using them throughout the workshop. If these tools are new to you, please spend some time familiarizing yourself. Your goal is the ability to setup and run a new app and feel comfortable editing some text in the JavaScript files. As a bonus, try to push your new app to a GitHub repository.

## 1. Git/GitHub source control

This part isn't critical, but we'll be occasionally pushing our code to a repo in the demo. If you would like to follow along with those steps, be sure to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and install Git for your operating system.

## 2. React Native - using Native

On [React Native's website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) there is a "Quick-Start" guide and a "Building Projects with Native Code" guide. We'll be using the "Building Projects with Native Code" option. Please follow the link above and follow the instruction under the "Building Projects with Native Code" tab.

## 3. Hello World - Goodbye World?

Each of the directions above, ask you to generate "AwesomeProject" and run it. If you've done that you're ready for our workshop! For extra credit, try editing the text in your app and push your project to a GitHub repository. You can follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) to help you get started.
